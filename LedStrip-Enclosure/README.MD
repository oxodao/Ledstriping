# 3d printable enclosure

This is a simple case made for the LedStrip board. Currently it works with a perfboard cutted in half.

This design will be reworked when the board will be designed and ordered.

## Required parts

- 3d printer
- PLA (Recommanded, or any other material you're comfident in)
- [Brass inserts (M3 * 6 * 4.2)](https://www.amazon.fr/YOFASEN-Pi%C3%A8ces-%C3%89crous-Filet%C3%A9s-Femelles/dp/B08K44KKYR/ref=sr_1_12?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=brass%2Binsert%2Bm3%2B6-4.2&qid=1620774689&sr=8-12&th=1) (Not sure they're the correct ones I have)
- [M3 Screw]() (Not found yet)

## Building it
### Printing
Print the given file. Standard setting will work good enough with PLA. You might need to adjust it if you print in other material.

This file requires support for the extruded holes for the ports and for the screwing holes.

### Assembling

Remove the supports under the screw hole and in the three ports.

To prepare the screw holes, just push the brass inserts with your soldering iron's tip.

Put the board in the box and screw the cover on the box
